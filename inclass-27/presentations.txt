1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?
    SpringMVC presentation is best prepared and polished because the presenter has a really good understanding of it after using it during an intership

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?
    Hybrid Mobile application presentation is the one that I have learned the most, because this is my first time hearing about hybrid mobile app dev. 
    I learned different ways of developing mobile apps, and why we do hybrid mobile apps, 
    and the advantages and disadvantages of doing the hybrid development like using cordova. 

3. Which talk did you like the best and why?
    ReflectJS presentation is very good. It is very clear about how to use reflect and the basic structure of reflect.
    The demo is very cool too, it shows what reflect could do and why we would want to use it.
