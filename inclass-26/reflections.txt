-What I hoped to learn but did not
    I actually really wanted to learn about AngularJS, but ReactJS was cool too

-What I really enjoyed learning about
    I really enjoyed learning NodeJS, ES6, and MongoDB because I am more of a backend guy
    but I also enjoyed learning how to use Redux for state management, which is a new paradigm for me

-What worked well in the course
    The knowledge that was introduced in the course could really prepare students for being a full-stack web developer

    -How
        Frameworks for both frontend and backend were introduced and fully practiced by building the web application

-What did not work well in the course
    I wish I spent more of my time learning about backend architectures and paradigms

    -How to improve
        Probably leaning the course a little more towards backend, talking about different structures and architectures

-What you could have done to help more
    I don't know

-What else
    I don't know
