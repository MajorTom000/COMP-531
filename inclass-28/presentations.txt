1. Which presentation was the most polished and delivered, and why?

Redis vs Memcached presentation is the most polished, it gives a deep analysis between pros and cons of redis and Memcached,
such as persistancy and reliability. It also gives a graph that shows the trend indicating the suggestion on which to choose.

 

2. Which topic did you learn the most from and what did you learn?

Database system presentation is interesting, I learned the pros and cons for SQL/Non-SQL based database system
I also learned that there's another language called N1QL, which is very similar to SQL, 
although I need to dig in by myself about why this N1QL exists and what advantages it provides over SQL. 


3. Which talk did you like the best and why?

I liked the D3 presentation because I wanted to learn about D3 but haven't got a chance. The presentation gives me a
good idea what D3 is, why we should use it and how we could use it. It also provides an opinion how D3 works under the hood.
The demo is cool too.
